# Added lasers:

Winning logic:
 - Double win occours when a player gets two sets of three-in-a-rows, and that player is awarded full wager.
 - When the game comes to a tie, a player wins thier opponent's expenditure and loses their own.

Eye candy and user-friendliness:
 - Player clicks on the chosen spot to move there.
 - Both board and pieces are images and have 3D-like perspective planes.
 - Images, rather than plain colors, are used as much as possible.
 - User-friendly terminology is used for deployer and attacher labeling.

Game modes:
 - Two different game modes are availible on the CLI version: Simulation mode and Live mode.
